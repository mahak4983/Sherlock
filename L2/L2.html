        <label for="question">Sherlock Holmes, the brilliant detective, was called to investigate a gruesome murder scene. As he combed through the
        evidence, his sharp eyes caught something peculiar. There was a small slip of paper tucked away in the pocket of the
        victim's coat. Sherlock carefully retrieved it and examined it closely. It was a cryptic clue, written in a mysterious
        code. Despite the complexity of the message, Sherlock was able to decipher its meaning. This single clue would prove to
        be the key that unlocked the secrets of the case and led him down a path to solve the mystery of the murder.
