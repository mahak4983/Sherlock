        <label for="question">Sherlock Holmes received an anonymous message containing a code related to a planned bank robbery. With his
        investigative skills, he deciphered the code and discovered the location of the planned heist. He quickly acted with Dr.
        John Watson to prevent the robbery and bring the culprits to justice. Sherlock's sharp mind and keen sense of
        observation allowed him to solve the case with ease, demonstrating once again why he is considered one of the greatest
        detectives of all time.
        The code that he received is "43 32 13 13".
